# Freediving Metrics Guide 🤿

**Quick reference for understanding your watch data and what it means for freediving performance**

---

## 🫀 Heart Rate Variability (HRV)

### What It Is
- Variation in time between heartbeats
- Measured in milliseconds (ms)
- **Higher = better** (in general)

### Why It Matters for Freediving
**Elite freedivers show:**
- 20-30% higher resting HRV vs untrained individuals
- Enhanced parasympathetic nervous system activity
- Faster recovery between dives

**Practical Use:**
- **High HRV (above baseline):** Ready for depth training, push limits
- **Normal HRV (at baseline):** Moderate training, technique work
- **Low HRV (below baseline):** Rest or light CO2 tables only
- **Suppressed HRV (>15% below):** Overtraining, take full rest day

### Typical Values
- **Untrained:** 30-50ms
- **Recreational freediver:** 50-70ms
- **Elite freediver:** 70-100ms+

### How to Improve It
- Quality sleep (8+ hours)
- Stress management (meditation, breath work)
- Adequate recovery between training
- Avoid alcohol, late-night eating
- Consistent training (avoid big gaps)

## 😴 Sleep Quality

### What It Tracks
- **Total duration** (hours)
- **Sleep stages:**
  - Deep sleep (restorative, physical recovery)
  - Light sleep (mental processing)
  - REM sleep (learning, memory consolidation)
  - Awake (interruptions)

### Why It Matters for Freediving
**During sleep:**
- HRV recovers to baseline
- Muscles repair from previous training
- Neural pathways strengthen (technique learning)
- Hormones regulate (cortisol, testosterone, growth hormone)

**Poor sleep = poor dive performance:**
- Reduced breath-hold capacity (up to 20%)
- Impaired focus (critical for safety)
- Slower reaction times (equalization issues)
- Elevated stress hormones (fights relaxation)

### Optimal Sleep for Freedivers
- **Duration:** 7.5-9 hours
- **Deep sleep:** 1.5-2 hours (20-25% of total)
- **REM sleep:** 1.5-2.5 hours (20-25%)
- **Sleep score:** 80+ (Garmin metric)

### Red Flags
- Less than 7 hours total
- Less than 1 hour deep sleep
- Multiple awakenings (>5)
- Sleep score below 60

**Action:** Rest day or light training only

## 🔋 Body Battery

### What It Is
- Garmin's proprietary energy score (0-100)
- Combines HRV, sleep, stress, activity
- Charges during rest, drains during activity

### How It Works
- **100:** Fully charged, peak energy
- **75-99:** Good energy, ready for training
- **50-74:** Moderate energy, light-moderate training
- **25-49:** Low energy, easy training or rest
- **0-24:** Depleted, rest required

### Why It Matters for Freediving
**Freediving is energy-intensive:**
- Mammalian dive reflex = physiological stress
- Cold water = increased calorie burn
- Equalization = requires mental focus
- Multiple dives = cumulative fatigue

**Body Battery correlates with:**
- Breath-hold time (lower battery = shorter dives)
- Depth capacity (need energy for ascent)
- Safety margin (fatigue = higher risk)

### Best Practices
- **Start dive sessions at 75+ battery**
- **Stop diving when battery drops below 40**
- **Recharge:** Nap, meditation, light stretching
- **Avoid:** Training on <50 battery repeatedly

## 😰 Stress Level

### What It Measures
- Sympathetic vs parasympathetic balance
- 0-25: Low stress
- 26-50: Moderate stress
- 51-75: High stress
- 76-100: Very high stress

### Why It Matters for Freediving
**Freediving requires relaxation:**
- **Low stress = slow HR = less O2 consumption**
- **High stress = elevated HR = shorter dives**

**Chronic high stress (>70 avg):**
- Suppresses HRV
- Impairs recovery
- Increases injury risk
- Reduces dive performance

### Managing Stress
**Pre-dive:**
- 10-15 min meditation
- Controlled breathing (box breathing: 4-4-4-4)
- Visualization (mental rehearsal of dive)

**Daily:**
- Track stressors (work, relationships, training)
- Balance hard training with recovery days
- Consider stress-reducing activities (yoga, nature walks)

## 🫁 Respiration Rate

### What It Is
- Breaths per minute (BPM) during rest/sleep
- Lower = better for freedivers

### Typical Values
- **General population:** 12-20 BPM
- **Trained freedivers:** 6-10 BPM
- **Elite freedivers:** 4-8 BPM at rest

### Why It Matters
**Lower respiration rate indicates:**
- Efficient breathing mechanics
- Better CO2 tolerance
- Enhanced relaxation capacity
- Improved parasympathetic tone

**Training to reduce it:**
- CO2 tolerance tables
- Diaphragmatic breathing practice
- Meditation with breath focus
- Slow breathing exercises (4-7-8, resonance breathing)

---

## 🏃 VO2 Max

### What It Is
- Maximum oxygen uptake (ml/kg/min)
- Measure of aerobic fitness
- Garmin estimates from running/cycling activities

### Why It Matters for Freediving
**Counterintuitive:**
- Freediving is anaerobic (holding breath)
- BUT: Higher VO2 max = better recovery between dives
- Allows more frequent training sessions
- Faster HR recovery post-dive

### Optimal Range for Freedivers
- **Good:** 45-55 ml/kg/min
- **Excellent:** 55-65 ml/kg/min
- **Elite:** 65+ ml/kg/min

**Improve it:** Running, cycling, swimming (aerobic base)

## 🤿 Dive-Specific Metrics

### Max Depth
- Deepest point reached (meters)
- **Track progression:** Aim for 1-2m increase per month (beginners)
- **Avoid:** Rapid depth increases (>10% per session)

### Bottom Time
- Duration at target depth (seconds)
- **Quality over quantity:** Relaxed 1:30 > stressed 2:00

### Total Dive Time
- Breath-hold duration (surface to surface)
- **Typical ranges:**
  - Beginner: 45-90 seconds
  - Intermediate: 90-180 seconds
  - Advanced: 180-300+ seconds

### Surface Interval
- Rest time between dives (seconds)
- **Optimal ratio:** 2-3x dive time (beginners), 1-1.5x (advanced)
- **Watch HRV recovery:** Should return to near-baseline

### Descent/Ascent Rate
- Speed of movement (m/s)
- **Optimal descent:** 0.7-1.0 m/s (controlled, relaxed)
- **Optimal ascent:** 0.5-0.8 m/s (slower = safer)
- **Red flag:** >1.2 m/s (too fast, equalization issues)

### Heart Rate During Dive
- **Pre-dive:** Baseline (60-80 BPM)
- **At depth:** Bradycardia (40-60 BPM = good, <40 BPM = excellent)
- **Post-dive:** Recovery to baseline in 30-90s

**Mammalian Dive Reflex Strength:**
- % HR reduction from baseline
- Stronger reflex = better O2 conservation
- Improves with consistent training

---

## 📊 Training Load

### Acute Load
- Last 7 days of training
- Measures short-term fatigue

### Chronic Load
- Last 4 weeks of training
- Measures fitness baseline

### Acute:Chronic Ratio
- **Optimal:** 0.8-1.3 (balanced)
- **Undertraining:** <0.8 (fitness declining)
- **Overtraining risk:** >1.3 (fatigue accumulating)

### For Freedivers
**Build slowly:**
- Increase dive volume by 10% per week max
- Mix hard days (depth) with easy days (dynamic/static)
- Every 3-4 weeks: recovery week (50% volume)

## 🎯 Readiness Score (Our Custom Metric)

### Formula
```
Readiness = (HRV_score × 0.4) + 
            (Sleep_score × 0.3) + 
            (Recovery_score × 0.2) + 
            (Training_load_score × 0.1)
```

### Interpretation
- **90-100:** Peak readiness - go for PBs, depth training
- **80-89:** Strong readiness - hard training, technique refinement
- **70-79:** Good readiness - moderate training, avoid pushing limits
- **60-69:** Borderline - light training (CO2 tables, stretching)
- **50-59:** Poor readiness - active recovery (yoga, walking)
- **<50:** Very poor - rest day, focus on sleep/nutrition

### What To Do
**High Readiness (>80):**
- Depth training (90% of max depth)
- PR attempts (if conditions right)
- High-volume sessions (8-12 dives)

**Moderate Readiness (60-80):**
- Technique work
- Dynamic apnea
- Light CO2 tables
- 4-6 dives, easy depth

**Low Readiness (<60):**
- Rest day
- Stretching, yoga
- Meditation, breath work
- Review video, study technique

## 📅 Weekly Monitoring

### Monday Morning Check
1. HRV: Above/below baseline?
2. Sleep: Quality score >75?
3. Body Battery: >70?
